class LeastConfidenceDropout(Strategy):
    """
    Implementation of Least Confidence Dropout Strategy.
    This class extends :class:`active_learning_strategies.strategy.Strategy`
    to include least confidence dropout technique to select data points for active learning.

    In this active learning strategy, the algorithm selects the data points for which the model has the lowest confidence while predicting its hypothesised label.
    
    
    .. list-table:: Example
       :widths: 25 25 25 25
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Data Instances
         - Label 1
         - Label 2
         - Label 3
       * - p1
         - 0.1
         - 0.55
         - 0.45
       * - p2
         - 0.2
         - 0.3
         - 0.5
       * - p3
         - 0.1
         - 0.1
         - 0.8

    
    From the above table, the label for instance p1 is 2 with a confidence of 0.55, for instance p2, the hypothesised label predicted is 3 with confidence of 0.5 and for p3 label 3 is predicted with a confidence of 0.8. Thus, according to least confidence strategy,  the point for which it will query for true label will be instance p2.

    Let :math:`p_i` represent probability for ith label and let there be n possible labels for data instance p then, mathematically it can be written as:
    
    
    .. math::
        \\min{(\\max{(P)})}  
    

    where P=:math:`[p_1, p_2,â€¦ p_n]`

    The drop out version uses the predict probability dropout function from the base strategy class to find the hypothesised labels.
    User can pass n_drop argument which denotes the number of times the probabilities will be calculated.
    The final probability is calculated by averaging probabilities obtained in all iteraitons.
